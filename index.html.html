            <h3> computer's use</h3>
            <p>Before you buy any components or establish a budget, you'll need to know what you plan on using the computer for. Standard desktop PCs which are used for things like browsing and minor programs (e.g., Microsoft Word and Excel) can use older, less expensive parts, while gaming- or editing-focused computers will need more powerful, up-to-date parts</p>

        <div class="step">
            <span>STEP 2</span>
            <h3>Know which components you need to buy</h3>
            <p>No matter how expensive your computer, you will need the following components for your project:
                <div>
                    Processor — Acts as the "brain" of your computer. <br>
                    Motherboard — Serves as an interface between all of your computer's components and the processor.<br>
                    RAM — Random Access Memory. More RAM will provide more "workspace" to increase your computer's performance. Think about the RAM as a table: more RAM gives you more room for doing things on that table. Less RAM is like having a smaller table!.<br>
                    Hard drive — Stores data. You can buy a traditional hard drive, or you can opt for a more expensive solid state drive (SSD) if you want an exceptionally fast drive.
                    Power supply — Powers all of your computer's individual components. The power supply is also the interface between your computer and the wall socket into which you plug your computer.<br>
                    Case — Necessary for storing and cooling your components.
                    Graphics card — Used to render images on your computer. While most processors have a built-in graphics processing unit (GPU), you can buy a dedicated graphics card if you plan on gaming or using your computer for intensive editing.<br>
                    Cooling system — Keeps the inside of your case at a safe temperature. Only necessary for gaming and editing PCs—regular PCs should be fine with a stock cooler.

        <div class="step">
        <span>STEP 3</span>
            <h3>First Things First</h3>
        <p>Before you build your PC, read the motherboard and case manuals to verify you have all the information you need for the installation. Gather all of the tools and materials you'll need for your project. A magnetic screwdriver makes guiding the screw into its hole much easier. If you wish to replace the existing compound with something that transfers heat better, you'll need thermal compound, a cleaning rag, and rubbing alcohol. Gloves protect your hands from nicks and scratches while also keeping grease away from the components.</p>
    </div>
    <img src="https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FGX/CZQV/FRXUT0AF/FGXCZQVFRXUT0AF.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&fit=bounds&md=7d2dc9a6dc7bf9c06aa851b4d205023f">
    <div class="step">
        <span>STEP 4</span>
            <h3>Beginning the Install: the Motherboard and Processor</h3>
            <p>The motherboard should come in an antistatic bag inside a small box. The bag will contain a thin anti-static foam pad to protect the board during it's travels. Using these accessories will ease installing the heatsink and protect the motherboard. If you bought a retail computer, it should come with a heatsink with a thermal pad or paste.</p>
    </div>
            <img src="https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FLX/DSPI/FRXUT0KT/FLXDSPIFRXUT0KT.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&fit=bounds&md=26b6db0da12ce27e7bbaa033a97ba04e">
    <div class="step">
        <span>STEP 5</span>
            <h3>Beginning the Install: Heatsink Installation</h3>
            <p>If the motherboard is installed in a case, there may not be much room to manuveur to install the heatsink. The heatsink pins will protrude through the bottom of the motherboard. This is where the antistatic pad comes in handy. Without the pad, the pin may not insert fully or worse, the plastic mount may become unuseable.
            </p></div>
            <img src="https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FOM/ZM76/FRXUT0M4/FOMZM76FRXUT0M4.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&fit=bounds&md=26b6db0da12ce27e7bbaa033a97ba04e">
            <div class="step">
                <span>STEP 6</span>
                <h3>Installing AMD Processors</h3>
                <p>If you have an AMD processor, the installation is a bit easier.
                    Lift the CPU lever, orient the CPU and drop it in. Press down on it and close the lever.
                    If you need to add thermal compound, wipe off the old compound and use a thin amount of the new compound. Using too much can increase heat retention.
                    Place the heatsink in the mounting bracket, loosen the latch, apply the clip to the mounting bracket, tighten the latch. Easy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
            <span>STEP 7</span>
            <h3>Installing Memory</h3>
            <p>Next, install the RAM into the RAM slots. Many motherboards have two pairs of color coded slots. To enable dual channel, you need to install memory in pairs. You also need to populate one set of color slots. Also be sure to install the proper RAM type. There are three primary types currently available, DDR, DDR2, and DDR3. DDR2 is currently the most popular (and cheapest). DDR RAM has 184 pins, DDR2 and DDR3 have 240 pins. These three types of RAM are about the same size, but have notches in different places.
                Align the notch on the RAM module with the notch in the RAM slot. Press down on the RAM module, then pull the white clips up to lock the RAM in place.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <span>STEP 8</span>
                <h3>Optional: Testing the Bundle</h3>
                <p>If you're afraid of breaking something, skip this step. Right now, all we're interested in is the power switch pins. Touching the wrong set of pins will not damage the board. If there is a switch on the back of the power supply, put it in the ON position. You should see the fan spin and the BIOS screen on the monitor.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/F6T/AGWR/FRXUT0O5/F6TAGWRFRXUT0O5.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&fit=bounds&md=22c9abb0a4d3f78097d27efa16d00f55">
            <div class="step">
                <span>STEP 9</span>
                <h3>Install the Bundle</h3>
                <p>Now we're on to the case. Remove the side panel. Install the power supply if necessary. The power supply can only be installed in one orientation.
                    Install the motherboard standoffs into the case. There's usually 6 for micro-atx motherboards and 6 to 10 for atx motherboards. Make sure you put the standoffs in the right places or you can cause a short circuit.
                    Snap in the I/O shield. Make sure it is fully inserted or the motherboard may not line up properly with the standoffs. You may need to bend some metal bars upwards to ease the installation of the bundle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <span>STEP 10</span>
                <h3>Fun With Wires</h3>
                <p>Now the fun part. Connecting the tiny wires for the front panel header. There will be at least four sets of wires (8 wires total): power, reset, power led, and hdd led. Take a look at the wires from the case. The ground wires will be either black or white. The important colors that we need to know are the orange cable which is the positive HDD led cable and the green cable which is the positive power led cable. If the orientation of the HDD led and power led are reversed, the light will not work. The orientation of the power switch and reset switch do not matter. Use the diagram in your motherboard manual to find the positive HDD led cable and positive power LED cable and connect those first in the proper orientation.Next, connect the power and reset cables.</p>

                <span>STEP 11</span>
                <h3>Drives and Connectors</h3>
                <p>There are two types of drives that are installed in computers, optical drives and hard disk drives. They come in two varieties, IDE and SATA. SATA is the newer standard utilizing thin cables and faster transfer speeds. All modern motherboards have SATA connectors whereas IDE connectors are fading out. <br>
                    When using IDE devices, be sure to properly set the jumpers for Master and Slave devices. There are three connectors on a standard IDE cable with a red stripe on one side of the cable. The red stripe will be closest to the power connector of the optical or hard disk drive. The blue connector goes to the motherboard. The device connected to the opposite end of the cable must be set to Master. The device connected to the middle of the cable must be set to Slave.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <span>STEP 12</span>
                <h3>Install Your Drives: Optical Drive</h3>
                <p>Cases can vary a great degree. Some cases use rails to mount the drives, some are screwless. Refer to your case manual on how the drives should be installed. I'll document how to install drives into a Cooler Master Centurion case as a reference and include photos of other cases. <br>
                    Optical Drive <br>
                Remove the front cover by lifting the front panel from the bottom of the case.
                Remove the metal EMI shield from the slot you plan on using. (I prefer using the top slot)
                Unscrew the slot cover. Replace the front cover.
                Install the optical drive by sliding the drive in from the front of the case until it's flush with the case. Slide the plastic lever forward and lock the drive in place.</p>
            </div>

                <span>STEP 13</span>
                <h3>Install Your Drives: Optical Drive (cont'd)</h3>
                <p>Some cases use a rail system. Some cases just need the slot cover removed and the drive slides in.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FU8/QHGJ/FRXUT0RZ/FU8QHGJFRXUT0RZ.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&crop=3:2&fit=bounds&md=08347c30bca32b22c9911f0e76a52342">
            <div class="step">
                <span>Step 14</span>
                <h3>Install Your Drives: Hard Drive</h3>
                <p>Install the HDD into a 3.5" bay. Slide the plastic lever forward and lock the drive in place. Connect the data cables for your devices. If you're using IDE devices, do not fold and flatten the cable. This can damage the wires in the cable causing errors.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <span>STEP 15</span>
                <h3>Finish It Up</h3>
                <p>If you have case fans, you'll either be plugging it into the motherboard or to the power supply. Plug in any other case cables you may have (Firewire, USB, audio). The cables are usually color coded.You can install any other add on cards you may have before installing the video card. Due to it's size, you should install the video card last. Remove slot cover(s) and install your video card. <br>
                    Plug in your power connectors. You'll be plugging in the primary 20/24 pin ATX cable, 4/8 pin CPU power cable, 6/8 pin video card cable (if necessary), and a power cable for each drive. Use cable ties and pads to organize the jumble of wires. That should be it! Plug in your power supply and test it out.
